                <p>Life is a game. Games such as Contra, a game with different levels. Levels are different phases in life. And one day this game will end and one day we will be gone. This the most complex game with many fixed and dynamic factors in life. Fixed factors would be like you need food, shelter to survive.Variable factors would be something like buying a Rs 10 or Rs 5 pen. Life is a decision making strategy game, where you need to optimize it for long run to win. It is a game that rewards you on taking risks, sometimes you fail and sometimes you pass. Although, I still have trouble playing it like a game as I take little risks but I am getting better at managing and taking risks in life.
                <br><br>
                This wonderful, rare life that we have been given either by God, a simulator orif we just came to be. All I know that we have been given a chance to be good and live in a society that has adjusted to survival very well and we can do so much good. We have been given a wonderful life to spend time on this planet in one of the most opportunistic time in a millennia and we have to use our life wisely and smartly and respectfully as we have been given.  So I feel life is a beautiful gift given to us from nature and we had made an easy survival atmosphere which paves the way to achieve big things in life from humans.</p>
